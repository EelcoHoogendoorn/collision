overload register_type for complete ndarray typedefs

add eigen::map to numpy funcs as well?
use this for inspiration?

add improved mode funcs


expose overloaded constructors in interface;
would be nice to be able to construct from existing pointgrid, so we can init permutation by copying

another speedup possibility; map triangle bbs to pointgrid; then intersect occupied cells before further processing
