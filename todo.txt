overload register_type for complete ndarray typedefs

add eigen::map to numpy funcs as well?
use this for inspiration?

make ndarray subclass of numpy::boost

think about class relations; composition vs inheritance. how much code can be shared between pointgrid and objectgrid?
use design pattern where by template base class method by subtype? ah just reinvented CRTP :)
constructor order determines a lot

further optimize pair generation

another speedup possibility; map triangle bbs to pointgrid; then intersect occupied cells before further processing

improve raytracing of spheres

add implicit integration; more efficient use of collision points

current hash map may degrade performance for adversarial grid shapes.
perhaps a binary-search-sorted map would be an improvement

fix bug in grid.update; currently causes crash


add example of hierarchical use of grid classes

release GIL where appropriate; perhaps reduce internal reliance on ndarrays

implement mesh chunking
