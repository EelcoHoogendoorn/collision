add cast back to numpy types
constructing empty array of novel type currently fails on incomplete typemap

retain type, ndim convention, since eigen uses it as well

strive for pure functions; keep mutable state in local scope
not a holy grail though; hashmap is sufficient immutable as is
only unhappy with pivots now

allow creation of const views on ndarrays; they are currently array_refs

lex-ordering is not n-dim compatible; need clever reduction; preferable compile-time

overload register_type for complete ndarray typedefs

update collisioninfo with all modern conveniences

merge this into trianglemesh? colinfo should come from trianglemesh
