add cast back to numpy types
constructing empty array of novel type currently fails on incomplete typemap

strive for pure functions; keep mutable state in local scope
not a holy grail though; hashmap is sufficient immutable as is
only unhappy with pivots now

allow creation of const views on ndarrays; they are currently array_refs


update collisioninfo with all modern conveniences

merge this into trianglemesh? colinfo should come from trianglemesh
