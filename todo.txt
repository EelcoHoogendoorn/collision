add cast back to numpy types
constructing empty array of novel type currently fails on incomplete typemap

retain type, ndim convention, since eigen uses it as well

overload register_type for complete ndarray typedefs

update collisioninfo with all modern conveniences

merge this into trianglemesh? colinfo should come from trianglemesh

add eigen::map to numpy funcs as well?
use this for inspiration?

add improved mode funcs

apply integer encoding scheme more generally; instead of computing integer encoding on the fly,
replace all cell calculations with it directly
