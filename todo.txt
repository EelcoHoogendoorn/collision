overload register_type for complete ndarray typedefs

add eigen::map to numpy funcs as well?
use this for inspiration?

further optimize pair generation

another speedup possibility; map triangle bbs to pointgrid; then intersect occupied cells before further processing
add objectgrid besides pointgrid?
would be nice if we can map triangles to objectgrid; derived class of pointgrid

improve raytracing of spheres

add simple fluid actor

add implicit integration

current hash map may degrade performance for adversarial grid shapes.
perhaps a binary-search-sorted map would be an improvement

fix bug in grid.update; currently causes crash
