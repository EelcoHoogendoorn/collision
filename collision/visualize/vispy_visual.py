# At this point the visual is ready to use, but it takes some extra effort to
# set up a Canvas and TransformSystem for drawing (the examples in
# examples/basics/visuals/ all follow this approach).
#
# An easier approach is to make the visual usable in a scenegraph, in which
# case the canvas will take care of drawing the visual and setting up the
# TransformSystem for us.
#
# To be able to use our new Visual in a scenegraph, it needs to be
# a subclass of scene.Node. In vispy we achieve this by creating a parallel
# set of classes that inherit from both Node and each Visual subclass.
# This can be done automatically using scene.visuals.create_visual_node():
MyRect = scene.visuals.create_visual_node(MyRectVisual)

# By convention, these classes have the same name as the Visual they inherit
# from, but without the 'Visual' suffix.

# The auto-generated class MyRect is basically equivalent to::
#
#     class MyRect(MyRectVisual, scene.Node):
#        def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
#            parent = kwds.pop('parent', None)
#            name = kwds.pop('name', None)
#            MyRectVisual.__init__(self, *args, **kwds)
#            Node.__init__(self, parent=parent, name=name)
#


# Finally we will test the visual by displaying in a scene.

# Create a canvas to display our visual
canvas = scene.SceneCanvas(keys='interactive', show=True)

# Create two instances of MyRect, each using canvas.scene as their parent
rects = [MyRect(100, 100, 200, 300, parent=canvas.scene),
         MyRect(500, 100, 200, 300, parent=canvas.scene)]

# To test that the user-specified transforms work correctly, I'll rotate
# one rectangle slightly.
